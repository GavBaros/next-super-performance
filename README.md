Partial hydration for [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) with [Preact X](https://github.com/developit/preact).

**Explanation:** At spring we are creating websites for newspapers and we are very, **very** performance aware.

Newspapers are mostly static pages. Now if we were to create a single page application we would
create a huge bundle with mostly unnecessary code.

This does not only mean that users wait for a big file to download, but [as Addy Osmami points out](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4)
there is a huge cost in performance with parsing and executing code. As a vague rule of thumb we can
say, the bigger your bundle, the worse your performance.

That is why we aim to cut bundle size by only shipping the code we actually need in the client and leave the rest to server side rendering.

## Overview

This repo ist still a proof of concept, we will continue to work on this and implement our work
as 2 packages:

- `pool-attendant-preact` A library that implements partialy hydration with preact x
- `next-super-performace` A Next.js plugin that uses pool-attendant-preact to improve client side performance

On top of partial hydration we will implement loading strategies including `critical CSS`, `critical JS`, `lazy loading`, `preloading ressources`, etc. as part of next-super-performace.
